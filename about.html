            I’m currently a scholar in a program called SMASH. This program is mainly focused on STEM which I’m really interested in.
            In this program every scholar is assigned to a group and each group has to come up with a finished project which
            consists of a website about a disease.Once this program is over I will be attending Philadelphia High School
            For Girls as a sophomore.

            My favorite subject is Algebra because I feel as though I succeed in it. Also, my Algebra 1 teacher taught it well and made
            it fun when I was in 9th grade. I like to partake in singing though I am not the best singer. I’m still trying
            to discover my talents. I enjoy going places with my family one of them being the beach. During my free time
            I watch movies, listen to music, and read books. Two strengths I possess are preserving and having faith in myself.
            These strengths helped me work hard and get a 3.98 GPA. One of my greatest accomplishments is getting accepted
            into Girls High because I had to get all A’s to get in. I see myself working in a hospital as a surgeon. I’m
            still unsure if I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon or a neurologist.

    <p id="title">About Me</p>
    <p id="favorite">I’m currently a scholar in a  program called SMASH. This program is mainly focused on the STEM which I’m really interested in. I will be a sophomore at Philadelphia high school for girls after this summer break.My favorite subject is Algebra because I’m actually good at it. Also, my Algebra 1 teacher explained it well and made it fun when I was in 9th grade. I like to sing a lot even though I’m not a really good singer. I  like to go to places like the beach with my family. During my free time,  I  watch movies, listen to music and read books. Two strengths I possess are never giving up and having faith in myself. These strengths helped me to get a good GPA.I’m still trying to discover my talents. One of my greatest accomplishments is getting accepted into girls High. I had to get all A’s in order to get into that school. I worked extra hard to get a 3.98 GPA. I  see myself working in a hospital and taking care of patients as a surgeon. I’m still trying to figure out if I want to be a neurological surgeon or cardiological surgeon.
